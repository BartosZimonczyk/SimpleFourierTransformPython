# SimpleFourierTransformPython
In this script I wanted to check if i can manage to code a program to handle discrete Fourier transform of a picture. It kinda worked!
If you want to start a program you need a pygame installed on your computer. Then, all you have to do is to start a main.py. At first you can draw a picture. Then after closing first window, a second one will open and show you how that picture look like after Fourier transform.
